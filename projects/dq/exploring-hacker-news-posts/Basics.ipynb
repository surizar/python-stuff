    "Exploring posts with either Ask HN or Show HN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Below are a couple examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?\n",
    "> Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?\n",
    "> Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, users submit Show HN posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting. Below are a couple of examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'\n",
    "> Show HN: Something pointless I made\n",
    "> Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Questions\n",
    "We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll be using the folowing kaggle [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The dataset was reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions."
